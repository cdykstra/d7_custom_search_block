d7_custom_search_block
======================
Add the following code snippet to template.php of your theme and you can:  
1. change the submit button to an image 
2. change the text of the submit button to 'Go!' (just remove the // in front of that line of code, and delete the image_button code below it)
3. add default 'Search this site' text in the input form and make it disappear when users click in the input form
